## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Carbon footprint calculator for households and businesses
- Detailed reports and donut chart representation.
- Responsive design for all devices
- User-friendly interface

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Render
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prithwe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd prithwe
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ./client
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your database details:

   ```env
   PG_USER=your_user_name
   PG_HOST=your_host_name
   PG_DATABASE=your_database_name
   PG_PASSWORD=your_password
   PG_PORT=5432
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secret
   MAIL=your_mail
   APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
   ADMIN_MAIL=admin_mail
   ADMIN_PASS=admin_password
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   OAUTH_SECRET=your_secret
   ```

6. Setting up App Password

   PrithWe uses `otp` for verification using gmail while registering and also for resetting password. And the otp is send to the gmail. And google does not allow to send otp directly from a website due to security reasons. For this purpose we use app password.

   Go to Manage your account. And search App. As shown below. And select App Passwords. 

   ![AppPassword](images/AppPassword1.png)

   Then create an App password by giving it any name(Ex: Otp) and copy the app password as it will be only shown once.

   ![AppPassword](images/AppPassword2.png)

   Then go to `.env` file and paste it as a String under APP_PASSWORD and remove all the space in between.

7. Building the Database Schemas

   After Successfully installing PostgreSql(PgAdmin 4) create a database with any name (Ex: PrithWe) as shown below.
   ![DataBase](images/database.png)

   Then inside the created database go to Schemas and right click on it and select Query tools as shown below.
   ![DataBase](images/QueryTools.png)

   After that paste the below code and run it.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    google_id VARCHAR(255),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    otp VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT '000000',
    otp_timestamp BIGINT,
    isVerified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE contact (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE household_common (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    electricity_usage DECIMAL,
    water_usage DECIMAL,
    waste_generation DECIMAL,
    gas_cylinder DECIMAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE business_common (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    electricity_usage DECIMAL,
    water_usage DECIMAL,
    paper_consumption DECIMAL,
    waste_generation DECIMAL,
    fuel_consumption DECIMAL,
    business_travel DECIMAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE family_members (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    household_common_id INT REFERENCES household_common(id),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    private_vehicle DECIMAL,
    public_vehicle DECIMAL,
    air_travel DECIMAL,
    veg_meals DECIMAL,
    non_veg_meals DECIMAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE recommendations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    household_common_id INT,
    business_common_id INT,
    recommendation TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (household_common_id) REFERENCES household_common(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (business_common_id) REFERENCES business_common(id)
);
```
   You will see tables for the database are created automatically.

8. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd ./server
   node index.js
   ```

9. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd ./client
   npm run dev
   ```

10. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
